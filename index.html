  <h1>üíñ Happy National BF Day, Jatyran üíñ</h1>

  <div class="note">
    Even though we were separated for almost a year, I never stopped loving you, and that only intensified it even more. You're all I think about‚Äîthe only person in the world that could ever be for me. I like to think I am the only person in the world who could ever be for you. We fit each other perfectly and balance each other out. I could not ask for anything different. These past three weeks with you have been nothing but greatness, even in the times you're gone, and it only makes me feel stronger about our connection and more grateful that I met the person meant for me at 23 years old. I am so excited to spend the rest of my life with you.
    <br><br>
    Even though I don't have the money to create something extravagant or buy you something insane, I wanted to make this day super special for you. I created some coupons for you on your desk‚Äîfeel free to use them (ANY DAY BUT TODAY, PLEASE)‚Äîand there's also a cute homemade puzzle for you to do when you get back. ALL CREATED BY ME, BTW. I want you to know and feel just how special you are to me.

      Hi! I know you're feeling down, and I just want you to know it's okay to feel that way. But never let yourself stay down forever. You are destined to shine and succeed. You radiate positive, growing energy that inspires everyone around you. Keep yourself alive and thriving‚Äîyou are just as important as anyone else.
    </div>

    <div id="angry" class="mood-card">
      Hi! I know you're upset right now‚Äîit may or may not be at me. I want you to take a moment, breathe, and think about what is causing your anger and the easiest way to solve it. Being angry gives your power away. Instead, be loving, forgiving, and hopeful. You are meant to shine like the star you are. Including me, no one should ever dim your light. My intentions will never be to make you feel down or angry; I only want us to succeed together, and I love watching you grow into the amazing man you are.
    </div>

    <div id="demotivated" class="mood-card">
      KEEP GOING! Keep pushing through. Times may get tough, but it was never meant to be easy. Hard work and perseverance are your path to greatness. You have been working tirelessly for years‚Äîdon‚Äôt let demotivation define you. You can take a break, but never, ever quit your dreams.
    </div>

    <div id="tired" class="mood-card">
      I'm so proud of you. I completely understand why you're tired. It's okay to rest, but never give up. Sometimes a break is necessary to re-align with your purpose and goals. Your best self is someone who can pursue success and dreams while maintaining balance. Rest, recharge, but never let go of your amazing potential.

    I'm going to be the best girlfriend and wife to you. I know I have made mistakes in the past, but I want to reassure you that I am here for you until the end of time. I am fully committed to growing with you, starting a family, growing old together, exploring the world, traveling, performing, and doing it all with you. It‚Äôs so much better knowing I have you by my side. You can always count on me to be there for you. Forever. That is a promise I will hold to the end. I love you forever, Jatyran Kaisai Williams, and you ARE my everything.
